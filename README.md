# Visual Memorability Behavioral Paradigm (jsPsych)

This repository contains the full experimental codebase for a large-scale visual memory study designed to quantify **image memorability**. The experiment is built using **jsPsych** and is optimized for deployment via **Pavlovia** / **Prolific**.

## 🚀 Overview

The paradigm is designed to decompose memorability into two uncorrelated components—**hit-ability** and **false-alarm-ability**—using **Signal Detection Theory (SDT)**. It features a high-throughput design capable of testing thousands of images across hundreds of participants.

## 📊 Data Availability

This repository contains the **experimental code only**. The behavioral data collected via this paradigm is proprietary and is not included here to maintain participant anonymity and comply with IRB protocols.
